# Convolution Neural networks 

## **Introduction**  
## TENSORFLOW :

* TENSORFLOW is an open source platform for machine learning, it is comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applocations 

## keras :

* Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.


## **Projects** 

#### CAT AND DOGS 

* Build the model binary classification image using Convolution , maxpooling and fully connected layers
* Using Image Classification transfer learning with Inceptionv3


###  Horse and humans 

* Build the model binary classification image using Convolution , maxpooling and fully connected layers 

### Tools 

* I design the model via google colabotary(colab notebook allows you to write and execute code python ) and it is saved into my Drive .
